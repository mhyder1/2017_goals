bind, call, apply
http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-apply-call-and-bind-methods-are-essential-for-javascript-professionals/
-object methods
-apply and call are similar, used to set "this" value explicitly
-bind used to set the "this" value on methods user.showData.bind(user)// bind "this" to user
-you can borrow methods with bind. add method from another object with bind (better to use call or apply)
-bind allows us to curry a function (preset one or more parameters)
-first parameter of bind() sets the 'this' value, use null if youre not using 'this'
